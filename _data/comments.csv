"Pierre-Yes Machavoine","Thank a lot for your work, Used it to make cd's for my grandparents. They're not so good with tech so plain old cd is the best way to make sure they can easily enjoy the music. Cheers!"
"Anonymous","Hey, thank you so much for this! There wasn't a way in hell I wasn't going to at least give you what I already give Spotify every month. Keep up the great work!"
"Anonymous","Cheers for this great piece of software! I'm not sure if you know, but it was kinda hard to find actually. I guess advertising beats the point, so whatever, enjoy your beer and thanks again :D."

"Alex F","An amazing application, truly. I always felt cheated by Spotify Premium being so limited, but this opens up a whole new world. Thank you."
"Anonymous","Great tool, thanks for making it free."
"addFlac please!","Hello! I love this application. It has allowed me to download my entire spotify music collection offline and to an older ipod I still use. I think today's constant connected online world is just too much. There is no reason I have to stream my favorite song over and over going through spotify DRM (and wasting data). This app has been so liberating. My music plays...no strings attached - EVER! I do have one suggestion if I may. In my opinion, this application would go from fantastic to perfect with the addition of .flac support. .flac is open source, lossless, and quite reasonably sized (especially compared to .wav) Thanks again for what you have built, a path away from forced digital restrictions management!"
"Anonymous","Hi, awesome work man! Can you also make it optional to inlude the interpret of the song to the title of the file (I guess prior to title would be best)? That way, if you mix up, you don't need to find out which song belongs to which author ;)"
"Zugidor Rodiguz","Support from an Irish student. Keep up the good work on Spytify!"
"Anonymous","Great work! ThX!"
"Anonymous","Thanks for providing this for free!"

"Fresh Dumb","Great Work! :)"
"Hoang Nguyen","Thank you man."
"Az Ows","Works really well, saved me buying a new car stereo which would have cost £££ i can just rip to mp3 and then put on CD now. Occasional crash but very stable generally. Thanks."
"Absolute Zer0","Thanks mate - very kind of you to make this available to people for free. Enjoy a beer on me!"
