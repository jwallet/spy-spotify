"Pierre-Yes Machavoine","Thank a lot for your work, Used it to make cd's for my grandparents. They're not so good with tech so plain old cd is the best way to make sure they can easily enjoy the music. Cheers!"
"Anonymous","Hey, thank you so much for this! There wasn't a way in hell I wasn't going to at least give you what I already give Spotify every month. Keep up the great work!"
"Anonymous","Cheers for this great piece of software! I'm not sure if you know, but it was kinda hard to find actually. I guess advertising beats the point, so whatever, enjoy your beer and thanks again :D."
"Anonymous","This is exactly what I need, thanks for creating and maintaining this!"
"Anonymous","Thank you so much!"
"Alex F","An amazing application, truly. I always felt cheated by Spotify Premium being so limited, but this opens up a whole new world. Thank you."
"Anonymous","Great tool, thanks for making it free."
"addFlac please!","Hello! I love this application. It has allowed me to download my entire spotify music collection offline and to an older ipod I still use. I think today's constant connected online world is just too much. There is no reason I have to stream my favorite song over and over going through spotify DRM (and wasting data). This app has been so liberating. My music plays...no strings attached - EVER! I do have one suggestion if I may. In my opinion, this application would go from fantastic to perfect with the addition of .flac support. .flac is open source, lossless, and quite reasonably sized (especially compared to .wav) Thanks again for what you have built, a path away from forced digital restrictions management!"
"Anonymous","Hi, awesome work man! Can you also make it optional to inlude the interpret of the song to the title of the file (I guess prior to title would be best)? That way, if you mix up, you don't need to find out which song belongs to which author ;)"
"Zugidor Rodiguz","Support from an Irish student. Keep up the good work on Spytify!"
"Anonymous","Great work! ThX!"
"Anonymous","Thanks for providing this for free!"

"Fresh Dumb","Great Work! :)"
"Hoang Nguyen","Thank you man."
"Az Ows","Works really well, saved me buying a new car stereo which would have cost £££ i can just rip to mp3 and then put on CD now. Occasional crash but very stable generally. Thanks."
"Absolute Zer0","Thanks mate - very kind of you to make this available to people for free. Enjoy a beer on me!"
"anthrax bulletproftlink","awesome tool spytify.. usefull for me $5"
"Anonymous","My dance class thanks you :-)"
"Anonymous","You've ushered in an iPod Revival ;) Thanks!"
"T H","Really good software, thanks!"
"Anonymous","Dude! I started fiddling around myself, trying to build something very similar to SpyTify - but when I went to the internet to find some info on the Spotify API I came across the SpyTify GitHub... You, sir.... You did an amazing job!"
"ABU DISCO","This is such an amazing and necessary tool for DJs. It's funny how small indepndant programmers like you can make tools far more useful and handy than rich tech companies can. Thank you for this."
"Anonymous","The software is super easy to set up, and does exactly what I want it to do! Please keep up the good work!"
"Tim Durachko","A+ software... Making a short slideshow, and this makes it soooo easy to add songs. Thanks!!"

"Pat Day","Great app. Great setup instructions. Really nice to also bundle with the virtual cable to maintain highest sound quality in recordings, WAV in my i nstance."
"Juan Jose Alamañac Mañez","Thanks for your program. On some occasions the songs give errors, speed up or lose parts. When they lose parts it is as if the needle of a vinyl record jumped, I don't know if it is because my computer and my internet connection are not very powerful."
"paul bogorin","The program is extraordinary. Kudos for your consistency. It helps me in my daily work at my job, I work with music and I need quality."
"Anonymous","Really great and stable program - you saved me a lot of time. Thank you! :)"
"Aloha Paradise","So much aloha to you and the ones you love from Big Island, Hawaii. Thank you my friend. Many will dance joyfully in your name. Last time I downloaded a playlist 10 months ago, the songs had too many artifacts; perhaps a problem on my end. But this time I think we have success. Once I listen through and check, I shall be back with more contributions again and again. You are kind and generous in offering this and your work by donation. I shall return <3"
"Ivan Z","Great piece of software for those who wants to use Spotify on DAPs!"
"Fuzz Wazz","Spytify + VB-Audio saved my life. You are wonderful, thank you ! Only bug: 1 in 10/20 songs doesn't have the metadata, meaning the file name contains the song+artist and nothing else."
"Anonymous","Fantastic Program and moreover reliably working!"
"Pal 9000","Cheers from the OFFIS Renegade Crew"
"Matt J","Superb program just what i've been looking for. Keep up the good work."
