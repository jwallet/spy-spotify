<section id="ad-and-track-overlap-on-recorded-track">
    <h3><a href="#ad-and-track-overlap-on-recorded-track">Ads and tracks overlap at the beginning/end of recorded tracks.</a></h3>
    <p><p>Use Audacity (a free editor for audio files) to cut the audio section that you want to remove and export it back to the same audio type. Spytify cannot guarantee that an ad or a track will be detected correctly since it’s based on a bit of information available in the Spotify process that is not always accurate.</p>
</p>
</section>

<section id="background-noice-recorded-on-track">
    <h3><a href="#background-noice-recorded-on-track">Background noise/sound was recorded on the saved track file.</a></h3>
    <p><p>First case, Spytify disables most apps when the recording session starts. Make sure to mute in the <em>Volume Mixer</em> all applications running in a background process in your system tray that can emit a sound as well as all applications that you open while recording. Only Spotify and Spytify should not be muted.
<br />
Second case, you might experiment some cracking/popping sounds when playing a recorded file. These sounds can be related to your computer not being set to high cpu performance. You can enable it in your power plan settings or by changing the minimum processor power state to 100 (look on Internet for a how-to). These sounds can also be related to the quality (bitrate) being different from Spotify to Spytify. You need to make sure that the Spytify bitrate quality matches your Spotify app version. Spotify Free can’t have the same quality as Spotify Premium. If you have Spotify Premium, you need to check the <strong>High Quality 320kbp</strong> chekbox in your Spotify settings to be able to use the highest recording quality in Spytify.</p>

<section id="get-mp3-metadata-from-spotify-api">
    <h3><a href="#get-mp3-metadata-from-spotify-api">Get MP3 metadata from Spotify API instead of Last.fm</a></h3>
    <p><p>This option is in development but can be set in the <strong>spytify.exe.config</strong> file. Open an text editor and follow the steps wrote as a comment at bottom of the file to enable the gathering of MP3 media info from Spotify.</p>
</p>
</section>

<section id="recording-order-number">
    <h3><a href="#recording-order-number">Parameter that adds a recording order number to the track.</a></h3>
    <p><p>Adding the recording order number to files <code class="highlighter-rouge">017_Artist_-_Title.mp3</code> is useful if you want to burn songs to CDs and that your MP3 player, like those in cars, orders songs by filename. You will get a CD with songs ordered in the same order than the album or the one shown by Spotify. If it’s a playlist, order it first on Spotify before recording it.</p>
</p>
</section>

<section id="spotify-audio-endpoint">
    <h3><a href="#spotify-audio-endpoint">Isolates Spotify audio to a different audio endpoint device.</a></h3>
    <p><p>By using the Spytify setting <strong>Audio Device</strong>, you can move Spytify to a different audio endpoint (install <a href="https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/">virtual audio cable</a> if you need another one) and use the Windows 10 setting to move Spotify to the same audio endpoint. Press Windows and type <strong>Sound mixer options</strong>, you should land on the setting page called <em>App volume and device preferences</em>, make sure Spotify is playing and set the app to the desired endpoint with the <strong>Output</strong> select list. Restart Spotify. Spotify and Spytify should now be isolated from any undesired sound. If you can’t find the Windows 10 setting, try the section <strong><em>Windows 10 Settings 🡂 System 🡂 Sound</em></strong>, scroll down to the <strong><em>Advanced sound options 🡂 App volume and device preferences</em></strong> setting.</p>
</p>
</section>

<section id="spotify-track-cut">
    <h3><a href="#spotify-track-cut">Spotify only plays a bit of a track, it stops playing it after some seconds.</a></h3>
    <p><p>Spotify looks for local music files before playing a track. If it finds one with the same metadata that the current song, it will play the local one instead. Cut track means that you started recording this track once and you ended the session too early. Just delete these incomplete tracks in your music directory to solve your issue.</p>
</p>
</section>

<section id="track-detected-as-ad">
    <h3><a href="#track-detected-as-ad">Tracks are detected as an ad.</a></h3>
    <p><p>Podcast, audio book and any other uncommon track type are detected as an ad. Also, Spotify doesn’t return to Spytify the right info when you switch between radios, playlists and albums, resulting in a track detected as an ad. If this happens, replay the current song, if this happens too often, create a playlist of the songs you want to save and play it. Spytify cannot guarantee that a track will be detected correctly since it’s based on a bit of information available in the Spotify process that is not always accurate.</p>
